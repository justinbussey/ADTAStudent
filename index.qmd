Hello,

My name is Justin Bussey (he/him), I am currently working at Bell Textron, Inc. My main responsibilities are to analyze data on inventory, costs, supplier performance, and other key metrics to provide feedback to internal customers.

I graduated from The University of North Texas with a bachelor's in aviation logistics and an MBA with a concentration in Business Analytics. I am a full-time student pursuing a master's in advanced data analytics. My expected graduation date is May 2023.

If I were to describe myself in three words: athletic, competitive, and realist.

If I had a magical machine learning algorithm that tells me the truth just 5 minutes before it happens I would utilize it to make myself a billionaire, then try to make the world a better place with the money I have.
